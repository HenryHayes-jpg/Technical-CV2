                 <h3>HTML 5</h3>
             </div>
             <p>I have been doing HTML since highschool and as I have mentioned, I built this very website using HTML, amongst a few other languages like CSS and JavaScript. During the process of building this website I found that a simplistic grid design is easy on the eye and it makes navigation simple and effective.</p>

         <div class = "skill-box">
            <div class = "skill-title">
                <div class = "img">
                    <img src="/img/Css.jpg" alt="Css img" class="skill-icon">
                </div>
                <h3>CSS 3</h3>
            </div>
            <p>Together with HTML 5, I used CSS to help design and style my frontend. I implemented several basic animations and interactive elements to give my website a more professional and rounded off look. Although it is not the best front end tool, it is simple, easy to learn and a great place for beginners to start styling.</p>
        </div>
        <div class = "skill-box">
            <div class = "skill-title">
                <div class = "img">
                    <img src="/img/js.jpg" alt="JS img" class="skill-icon">
                </div>
                <h3>JavaScript</h3>
            </div>
            <p>I tended to the back-end functionality with JavaScript. This language is still relatively new to me, but I can already spot the benefits of learning this language with its wide scope of functionality. I've done a fair share of coding in Java and transitioning that knowledge into JavaScript has certainly provided me with a good platform to build on</p>

                </div>
                <h3>Python</h3>
            </div>
            <p>Python has been a staple language of mine throughout my university career. I enjoy using Python as it is easy to read and implement and offers a wide scope of libraries such as RDFlib, that makes it simple to formulate and solve problems </p>

                </div>
                <h3>C#</h3>
            </div>
            <p>Throughout my time as a programmer, C# has been one of the more pleasant and easy languages to learn. If used in combination with Visual Studio, the syntax is very easy to learn(especially with a background in C) and the fluent design capabilities paired with user-friendly code editing makes it a fun language to use. I would recommend this language to inexperienced programmers</p>

                </div>
                <h3>C++</h3>
            </div>
            <p>C++ was my introduction to object-oriented programming. I was relatively inexperienced when I started learning this language which meant I faced a steap learning curve. I however soon felt more and more confident as I started discovering the benefits of this powerful language. If used correctly, one can utilize speed, ability and cheap resource usage.</p>
